# Binary Tree
## Description
In this repository  a collection of funtions of handler binary tree data structure and each big o notation in files
## Concepts
|  What is a binary tree? |
|:--:|
| A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child. 


## Terminologies

| **Node**
|:--:|
| the basic representation of a given point in a tree.
| **Root Node**
| The topmost node of a Binary Tree.
| **Parent Node**
| If a node is connected to another node through edges, it is known as a parent node. In a binary tree, a parent node can have a maximum of 2 child-nodes.
| **Child Node**
| If a node has a predecessor, it is known as child node.
| **Leaf Node**
| A node that does not have any child node is called as a leaf node. 
| **Depth of a node**
| It is the distance from the root node to that particular node whose depth is to be measured.
| **Height of the tree**
| It is the longest distance from the root node to the leaf node.


## Prerequisites
* __gcc__ the GNU Compiler Collection is an optimizing compiler 
* __valgrind__ is a programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. 
* __betty__ is a C code checker written in Perl.
* __gdb__   the GNU Debugger is a portable debugger that  works for many programming languages, including C and others.
## Compile
build the binary
```cmd
$ make build SRC=<name of task file> MAIN=<name of main file to build>
$ ./binary_tree
```
build the binary executed and delete
```cmd
$ make run SRC=<name of task file>  MAIN=<name of main file to run>
```
